# Wordpress Post Creator using Selenium UI Automation

## Description:
This script allows you to insert multiple articles that are stored as txt files to your Wordpress website. 

## Setup:
When I created this project I used:
- Python 3.8
- Pyperclip
- Selenium
- Chrome Webdriver

## Usage:
In order to run this project you need to provide a route, password and username.
You will also need to create a directory called "articles". Here you will put as txt files the files that you want to upload as posts to Wordpress.
